# Gravity Forms SCSS

Gravity Forms styles for use in [Alpha](https://github.com/wpsitecare/alpha), [Foxtrot](https://github.com/wpsitecare/foxtrot), and any other Sassy WordPress theme.

__Contributors:__ [Ozzy Rodriguez](https://github.com/ozzyrod), [Robert Neu](https://github.com/robneu)  
__Requires:__ WordPress 4.5, Gravity Forms 1.9  
__Tested up to:__ WordPress 4.5, Gravity Forms 1.9.17.4  
__License:__ [MIT](http://wpsitecare.mit-license.org/)  

### Usage

The easiest way to use these styles is to clone them into your theme and integrate them into your build process. They will work out of the box with the Alpha and Foxtrot starter themes. They share the same variable and dependency structure as [Alpha](https://github.com/wpsitecare/alpha) and [Foxtrot](https://github.com/wpsitecare/foxtrot), so you may need to make adjustments if you want to use the styles in another theme. Please feel free to fork and adapt these styles to meet your own needs!
